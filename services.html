            <h3>CV and candidate profiling</h3>
            <p>To hire fairly and effectively, a recruitment team needs to agree on exactly what each role requires and the people that may be successful in those roles. Writting a candidate profile, a document that includes job tasks, necessary skills and
                desired qualifications, can help you focus your hiring process. Collecting this information in a candidate profile facilitates communication along the hiring process from interviewers to future managers. At Osaat Hires we help you with
                this as you focus on the business.</p>
